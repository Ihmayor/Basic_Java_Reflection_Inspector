Refactoring:

Bad Smell: Duplicated Code 

Fix: Used Extracted Method on inspect() and inspectRecursive() which resulted in the following methods: 

- inspectConstructors
- inspectMethods 
- inspectSuperInterface
- inspectSuperClass
- inspectFields
- getNonRecursiveValue
- getPrimitiveValue
- addHashCode
- calculateTabOver
- isInspected

Steps of Identify, Extract, Replace and Unit Test were repeated for every method above.
